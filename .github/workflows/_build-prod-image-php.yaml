# To use this and subsequent jobs you need to fulfill all following requirements:
# 1. Create REGISTRY_NAME configuration variable in your GitHub (see https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#creating-configuration-variables-for-a-repository),
#    e.g. for a GCP the variable should have a value "{LOCATION}-docker.pkg.dev/{PROJECT-ID}/{REPOSITORY}" (see https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/pushing-and-pulling#tag)
# 2. Make sure your self-hosted GitHub runner is authenticated to your registry provider and has sufficient rights to push.
#    (e.g. for a GCP see https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/pushing-and-pulling#auth)
