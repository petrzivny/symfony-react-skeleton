:warning: **This project is in work in progress state**: For example React (FE) is not implemented so far. Symfony (BE) and DevOps is functional. See [What is included out-of-the-box](#what-is-included-out-of-the-box) section for what is already included.

### Prerequisites
1. [Docker (and docker compose) installed. You don't need Docker Desktop for this project.](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
2. npm? node? npm install -g npm@latest

## How to start local development
```bash
git clone git@github.com:petrzivny/symfony-react-skeleton.git
cd symfony-react-skeleton
mv api/.env.local.dist api/.env.local
cd .docker && docker compose --env-file ../api/.env.local up -d
```

### Run production (deployment) version of php and nginx locally
```bash
cd .docker && docker compose --env-file ../api/.env.local -f docker-compose-prod.yaml up -d
```

### Deploy to GCP cloud (this example is configured out-of-the-box for [this infrastructure](https://github.com/petrzivny/infrastructure))
1. Provision your infrastructure by using mentioned infrastructure template. Save output values from terraform apply. You will use them in point 3. and 4. (or use your own infrastructure).
2. `cd .deploy`
3. Edit Chart.yaml and values.yaml files (use outputs from infrastructure terraform provisioning).
4. `helm install your-app-name . --namespace {app_k8_namespace} --create-namespace`

### What is included out-of-the-box
1. Docker to run complete dev environment (php + nginx + PostgreSQL)
2. Symfony framework as a backed REST api
   - Independent on any used frontend. Communicating via REST (_best-practice_ üéØ)
   - [x] Symfony opcache preloading with JIT in prod (_performance_ ‚è©).
   - [x] Xdebug setup to debug both html requests and CLI commands.
   - [x] Phpstan in a very strict level.
   - [x] PHP_CodeSniffer in a very strict level (lots of rules are my personal "taste", feel free to change/remove them).
   - [x] Psalm.
   - [x] Roave/SecurityAdvisories to prevent using dependencies with known security vulnerabilities.
   - [x] PHPUnit Unit tests.
   - [x] PHPUnit Functional tests (including smoke tests).
   - [x] Other linters (Composer, Yaml, Symfony container).
   - [x] Php-fpm access proper logging (json format, GCP [LogEntry](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/v2/rest/v2/LogEntry#httprequest) compatible, correct severity, trying to fix https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=73886)
   - [x] Symfony monolog proper logging (json format, GCP compatible using GoogleCloudLoggingFormatter)
3. React framework as a frontend SPA
   - Independent on any used backend. Communicating via REST (_best-practice_ üéØ)
   - [x] Typescript
   - [x] Eslint
   - [x] Vite
   - [x] wsc (should be 20x faster than Babel but see the current [caveats](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc#caveats))
   - [x] Prettier
4. DevOps: CI pipeline to build both test and prod images, test them and push prod images to registry
   - [x] Run all tests from point 2 on final (test) docker image (_best-practice_ üëç).
   - [x] If everything passes there are php and nginx environment agnostic (_best-practice_ üëç) containers ready to be shipped into any environment (including prod of course).
   - [x] Pipeline expects self-hosted GitHub runner(s). [See](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners) for more information.
5. DevOps: Kubernetes deploy manifests
   - [x] Platform agnostic. As long as there is a Kubernetes you can use simple config files in `.deploy` dir to deploy to your environment (just a test, not production ready!).
   - [x] One pod for nginx, one pod for php for better scalability (_best-practice_ üëç).
   - [x] Ingress to connect your kubernetes cluster with outside world (you can use platform Load Balancer, but it is usually billed).

### XDEBUG setup in PphStorm (with first debug call)
Xdebug is configured out-of-the-box in container for all CLI commands, for browser I recommend to install [Xdebug helper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xdebug-helper/eadndfjplgieldjbigjakmdgkmoaaaoc), or other similar tool to add XDEBUG_SESSION cookie to requests.

1. Click on "Start listening for PHP Debug Connection"
2. Perform any request from your browser (with a XDEBUG_SESSION cookie, see description few lines before)
3. If asked by PhpStorm to provide server mappings, do it like this ![xdebug-mappings.png](documentation%2Fimages%2Fxdebug-mappings.png)
4. If you want to xdebug CLI calls use `xphp` alias defined in docker container
```bash
docker exec -it symfony-react-skeleton_php sh -l
xphp bin/console debug:dotenv
```

#### Prerequisites
1. docker installed
2. git installed

#### Recommended prerequisites
1. Crete global `.gitignore` file in a parent directory for your project and add `.idea` line in it. This directory created by PhpStorm in every project should not be versioned but should not be included in project's scope .gitignore file either (_best-practice_ üëç).
2. GitHub repository.
3. At least one self-hosted GitHub runner to fully enjoy benefits of out-of-the-box CI pipeline.

## Frequently Asked Questions
- [How to run CI tests locally?](#how-to-run-ci-tests-locally)
#### How to run CI tests locally?
A developer can run all BE tests at once `composer test` or only selected BE test can be ran e.g. `composer phpstan`. Commands should be run inside php container.
A developer can run all FE tests at once `pnpm run test` or only selected FE test can be ran e.g. `pnpm run lint`.
