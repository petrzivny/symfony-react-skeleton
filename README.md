<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
A template to jumpstart your new greenfield project. If you are a startup or an entrepreneur thinking to start a new project with php and symfony as a BE and Typescript and React as a FE, consider to use Symfony React skeleton and save weeks of development.

This project covers common (repetitive) parts of most greenfield projects. Fully functional and communicating BE and FE parts via REST, CI pipeline with robust tests and helm deployment.

On top of it you will receive BE, FE and DevOps best practices already implemented. You software development team can follow these guidance to deliver sustainable and maintainable top quality product.

Don't forget to give the project a star!

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [docker (and docker compose) installed.](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) You don't need Docker Desktop for this project. 
* [node](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-22-04#option-3-installing-node-using-the-node-version-manager) 
* [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
* OPTIONAL: [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) for deploying to kubernetes cluster 
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Installation
1. Clone the repo. Replace {myproject} with a name of your new project/app. It is important to stay in one terminal window during all install steps, otherwise PROJECT_NAME needs to be set again.
   ```sh
   PROJECT_NAME={myproject}
   git clone https://github.com/petrzivny/symfony-react-skeleton.git $PROJECT_NAME && cd $PROJECT_NAME
   ```
2. Setup environmental variables by using prepared template
   ```sh
   cp api/.env.local.dist api/.env.local
   ```
3. Change name of your project (application) from symfony-react-skeleton to {myproject}. You can do it in your editor or use following command. Choose only one.
   ```sh
   # Linux
   sed -i "s/\${PROJECT_NAME:-symfony-react-skeleton}/$PROJECT_NAME/g" .docker/docker-compose.yaml .docker/docker-compose-prod.yaml 
   
   # MacOS
   sed -i '' "s/\${PROJECT_NAME:-symfony-react-skeleton}/$PROJECT_NAME/g" .docker/docker-compose.yaml .docker/docker-compose-prod.yaml
   
   # Manually
   # Replace all occurrences of string "${PROJECT_NAME:-symfony-react-skeleton}" with {myproject}.
   ```
4. Build BE docker images and run them as docker containers in dev mode
   ```sh
   cd .docker && docker compose --env-file ../api/.env.local up -d
   ```
   Don't worry about nginx and php Errors or Warnings, it just means docker images needs to be build for a first time.
   Try `docker ps`. 3 containers should be up and running (php, nginx, postgres), if not, try `docker ps -a` and `docker log`.
5. Install php dependencies (inside php docker container)
   ```sh
   docker exec -it ${PROJECT_NAME}_php composer i
   ```
6. Try to run http://localhost:81/api/status to check if BE is running properly (you should see 200 JSON response with debug info). I recommend to use [this chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonvue/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc) to format json responses.
7. Install javascript dependencies
   ```sh
   cd ../fe && pnpm install
   ```
8. Run FE hot reload dev server
   ```sh
   pnpm run dev
   ```
9. Visit http://localhost:5173/. You are ready to start local development. Happy coding.

Next time you only need to perform points 4. and 8. to start developing. I recommend to set up an <a href="#setup-alias-for-fast-start-of-development">alias</a> for them.
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Linking your remote repository
At this moment your only remote repository is origin: https://github.com/petrzivny/symfony-react-skeleton.git. But you need to have your own remote repository connected too (I recommend to leave original repository if you want to contribute this public project in future).
```shell
# rename origin: https://github.com/petrzivny/symfony-react-skeleton.git to template: https://github.com/petrzivny/symfony-react-skeleton.git
git remote rename origin template

# Create a new repository (preferably on GitHub to use all features of this template)
git remote add origin url_of_your_repo 
#eg: git remote add origin git remote add origin git@github.com/petrzivny/myproject.git

git push -u origin main
```
Take a look into your GitHub repository. All code should be there and your first GitHub Actions pipeline should be initiated. At this point you will need to configure self-hosted runners.

## What is included out-of-the-box
1. Docker to run complete dev environment (php + nginx + PostgreSQL)
2. Symfony framework as a backed REST api
   - [x] Independent on any used frontend. Communicating via REST. (_best-practice_ üéØ)
   - [x] Symfony tuned for [best performance](https://symfony.com/doc/current/performance.html) in prod. (_performance_ ‚è©).
   - [x] Opcache php preloading + symfony recommended optimization (_performance_ ‚è©).
   - [ ] Php JIT not implemented. JIT increase performance only in high concurrency regime while in low concurrency it is more performant to not use JIT (_performance_ ‚è©).
   - [x] Zero trust, the least privilege and giving as minimum as possible information principles used in nginx.conf (_best-practice_ üéØ).
   - [x] Xdebug setup to debug both html requests and CLI commands.
   - [x] Phpstan in a very strict level. Including [shipmonk-rules](https://github.com/shipmonk-rnd/phpstan-rules).
   - [x] PHP_CodeSniffer in a very strict level (lots of rules are my personal "taste", feel free to change/remove them). Including [phpstan-strict-rules](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-strict-rules) and [slevomat-coding-standard](https://github.com/slevomat/coding-standard)
   - [x] Psalm.
   - [x] Roave/SecurityAdvisories to prevent using dependencies with known security vulnerabilities.
   - [x] PHPUnit Unit tests.
   - [x] PHPUnit Functional tests (including smoke tests).
   - [x] Other linters (Composer, Yaml, Symfony container).
   - [x] Php-fpm access proper logging (json format, GCP [LogEntry](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/v2/rest/v2/LogEntry#httprequest) compatible, correct severity, trying to fix https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=73886)
   - [x] Symfony monolog proper logging (json format, GCP compatible using GoogleCloudLoggingFormatter)
3. React framework as a frontend SPA
   - Independent on any used backend. Communicating via REST (_best-practice_ üéØ)
   - [x] Typescript
   - [x] Eslint
   - [x] Vite
   - [x] React Query and Axios for proper data fetching including caching
   - [x] wsc (should be 20x faster than Babel but see the current [caveats](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc#caveats))
   - [x] Prettier
4. DevOps: CI pipeline to build both test and prod images, test them and push prod images to registry
   - [x] Run all BE tests from point 2 on final (test) docker image (_best-practice_ üëç) (Phpstan, CodeSniffer, Psalm, PHPUnit, linters, etc ...).
   - [x] Run helm lint and helm dry installation into minikube cluster to ensure real deployment will be without surprises.
   - [x] If everything passes there are php and nginx environment agnostic (_best-practice_ üëç) containers ready to be shipped into any environment (including prod of course).
   - [x] Pipeline expects self-hosted GitHub runner(s). [See](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners) for more information.
5. DevOps: CD
   - [x] Helm kubernetes deploy manifests prepared to deploy your app in any kubernetes environment.
   - [x] Platform agnostic. As long as there is a Kubernetes you can use simple config files in `.deploy/helm` dir to deploy to your environment.
   - [x] Separate pods for nginx and php for better scalability (_best-practice_ üëç).
   - [x] Both nginx and php pods have readiness probes.
   - [x] Both nginx and php pods have liveness probes.
   - [x] Optional: Ingress to connect your kubernetes cluster with outside world (you can use platform Load Balancer, but it is usually billed).
6. Security:
   - [x] Secrets are not stored in file system, thus prevent directory traversal attack (_best-practice_ üëç).
   - [x] Secrets are not stored as environment variables, thus prevent any debug or log attacks or misconfigurations (_best-practice_ üëç).

## How to code like a PRO
All the following setup information are **optional**, but highly **recommended**. It should not take you more than 10 minutes of setup time, and it will save you hours of your time in a future. Senior developer uses all of them. Period. 
### Use PHPStan
PHPStan is configured out of the box. For a better DX configure your IDE too. See [PHPStan usage](documentation%2Fphpstan%2FREADME.md) for more details.
### Use PHP_CodeSniffer
PHP_CodeSniffer is configured out of the box. For a better DX configure your IDE too. See [PHP_CodeSniffer usage](documentation%2Fphpcs%2FREADME.md) for more details.
### Use Xdebug
Xdebug is configured out of the box on the container side. You need to configure your IDE too. See [Xdebug usage](documentation%2Fxdebug%2FREADME.md) for more details.
### Setup alias for fast start of development
Setup alias in your shell to deliver points 3., 4. and 5. from <a href="#installation">Installation</a>
For example what I have in my `.zshrc` file: 
```shell
alias dcs="cd ~/Projects/personal/symfony-react-skeleton/.docker/ && docker compose --env-file ../api/.env.local up -d && cd ../fe && pnpm run dev"
alias des='docker exec -it symfony-react-skeleton_php sh -l'
```
I use `dcs` to start complete FE+BE dev environment and `des` to docker exec into php container. 
### Globally gitignore your IDE
Create a global `.gitignore` file in a parent directory for your project and add `.idea` line in it (.idea is for PhpStorm, if you use another editor, change the directory name accordingly). This directory created by PhpStorm in every project should not be versioned but should not be included in project's scope .gitignore file either (_best-practice_ üëç).

## Deploy to cloud
This example is configured out-of-the-box for [infrastructure-skeleton](https://github.com/petrzivny/infrastructure-skeleton). It is useful for debugging or if you want to see your app running in prod ASAP. Real world deployment should be setup in CD pipeline.
1. Provision your infrastructure by using [infrastructure-skeleton](https://github.com/petrzivny/infrastructure-skeleton). Save output values from terraform apply. You will use them in following steps. You can use your own infrastructure, in that case use your own output parameters.
2. Change `parameters.application_name:` parameter in api/config/services.yaml. Use `app_name` output from terraform apply.
3. Build and push your prod images. For this you need `artifact_registry` terraform output.
   ```sh
   # for {image_name} use {artifact_registry from terraform output}/{myproject} eg.: IMAGE_NAME=europe-west1-docker.pkg.dev/basic4-2542859/all-registry-europe-west1/symfony-react-skeleton
   IMAGE_NAME={artifact_registry}
   cd .docker && IMAGE_NAME="${IMAGE_NAME}" docker compose -f docker-compose-prod.yaml build
   docker push "${IMAGE_NAME}/nginx"
   docker push "${IMAGE_NAME}/php"
   ```
4. Edit values.yaml file (use `app_environment`, `gcp_project_id`, `app_gcp_service_account_name` and `app_k8_service_account_name` outputs from infrastructure terraform apply from point 1.). Don't forget to edit also `host` which will be your url.
5. Change `name` in .deploy/helm/Chart.yaml for example use `app_name` output from terraform apply.
6. Deploy your pushed images into k8 cluster created in point 1. For this you need `app_k8_namespace` terraform output. You can choose any string for `{helm_release_name}`.
   ```sh
   K8_NAMESPACE={app_k8_namespace}
   HELM_RELEASE={helm_release_name}
   cd ../.deploy/helm
   helm upgrade --install --create-namespace $HELM_RELEASE . \
      --namespace "${K8_NAMESPACE}" \
      --set image.nginx="${IMAGE_NAME}/nginx" \
      --set image.php="${IMAGE_NAME}/php" 
   ```
6. Since you probably don't have DNS setup yes, try to access deployed app via curl. IP can be grabbed [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/ingresses).

## Frequently Asked Questions
- [How to run CI tests locally?](#how-to-run-ci-tests-locally)
- [How to run BE application in prod mode locally?](#how-to-run-be-application-in-prod-mode-locally)
#### How to run CI tests locally?
A developer can run all BE tests at once `composer test` or only selected BE test can be ran e.g. `composer phpstan`. Commands should be run inside php container.
A developer can run all FE tests at once `pnpm run test` or only selected FE test can be ran e.g. `pnpm run lint`.
#### How to run BE application imitating prod mode locally?
1. Uncomment services.php.environment section in `.docker/docker-compose-prod.yaml` to be able to connect to local DB if needed.
2. `cd .docker && docker compose -f docker-compose-prod.yaml up -d`
